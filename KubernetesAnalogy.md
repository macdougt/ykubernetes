# Kubernetes is like a Company?

## Structural Analysis

### Company (Kubernetes Cluster)
The entire Kubernetes cluster is like a large company. This company has various departments, teams, and management levels to ensure the business operations run smoothly.

### CEO and Executive Team (Master Node)
Coordinates all activities, plan resources, and ensure that everything runs smoothly.

#### API Server (Executive Assistant to the CEO)
The entry point for all requests and ensures they are forwarded to the right departments.

#### Scheduler (Operations Manager)
Decides the best allocation of resources (teams, tasks, equipment) for each project based on availability and requirements.

#### Controller Manager (Project Managers)
Ensures that the company's operations follow the planned schedules and strategies. They ensure that projects are completed and maintained as planned.

#### etcd (Corporate Data Repository)
Keeps track of all essential corporate data, such as business records, project schedules, and company plans.


### Departments (Worker Nodes)

This is where the actual work happens. These departments host the teams, projects, and resources necessary for business operations.

#### Pods (Teams): 
Handle one or more projects or tasks (containers). Just like teams in a company, pods have a defined structure and purpose.

#### Containers (Employees)
The smallest units where specific activities occur, such as developing a product or handling a customer service request.

### Team Leads (Kubelet)
Ensures that all projects or tasks (pods) in their department (worker node) are functioning properly. They report back to the executive team (master node) with updates.

### IT Department (Kube-Proxy)
Ensures that data (network traffic) gets routed to the correct teams or projects (pods) efficiently and handles network rules and load balancing.

### Corporate Services (Services)
Ensures that each team or project (pod) gets the necessary support, such as HR, finance, and office supplies.

### Divisions (Namespaces)
Manage different business units or functions. Each division works independently but under the same company umbrella.

## Scenario

Imagine a new product (application) needs to be developed:

### Request at Headquarters
A product manager submits a request to the executive assistant (API Server) to develop a new product.

### Planning and Scheduling
The operations manager (Scheduler) decides the best allocation of resources (teams, tasks, equipment) for the new product based on availability and requirements.

### Assigning Teams and Tasks
The project managers (Controller Manager) ensure that the project is assigned to the appropriate teams (pods) and people (containers) are assigned the tasks as per the project plan.

### IT Support
The IT department (kube-proxy) ensures that the necessary network and technical support is provided to the teams.

### Ongoing Supervision
The team leads (kubelet) continuously check to ensure that each task or project remains on track and reports any issues to the executive team.

### Corporate Services
The teams are connected to necessary corporate services, such as HR and finance, to ensure the project runs smoothly.
