# Kubernetes is like a Company?

## Company (Kubernetes Cluster)
The entire Kubernetes cluster is like a large company. This company has various departments, teams, and management levels to ensure the business operations run smoothly.

## CEO and Executive Team (Master Node)
Coordinates all activities, plan resources, and ensure that everything runs smoothly.

### API Server (Executive Assistant to the CEO)
The entry point for all requests and ensures they are forwarded to the right departments.

### Scheduler (Operations Manager)
Decides the best allocation of resources (teams, tasks, equipment) for each project based on availability and requirements.

### Controller Manager (Project Managers)
Ensures that the company's operations follow the planned schedules and strategies. They ensure that projects are completed and maintained as planned.

### etcd (Corporate Data Repository)
Keeps track of all essential corporate data, such as business records, project schedules, and company plans.


## Departments (Worker Nodes)
This is where the actual work happens. These departments host the teams, projects, and resources necessary for business operations.

### Pods (Teams): 
Handle one or more projects or tasks (containers). Just like teams in a company, pods have a defined structure and purpose.

### Containers (Employees)
The smallest units where specific activities occur, such as developing a product or handling a customer service request.

## Team Leads (Kubelet)
Ensures that all projects or tasks (pods) in their department (worker node) are functioning properly. They report back to the executive team (master node) with updates.

## IT Department (Kube-Proxy)
Ensures that data (network traffic) gets routed to the correct teams or projects (pods) efficiently and handles network rules and load balancing.

## Corporate Services (Services)
Ensures that each team or project (pod) gets the necessary support, such as HR, finance, and office supplies.

## Divisions (Namespaces)
Manage different business units or functions. Each division works independently but under the same company umbrella.
