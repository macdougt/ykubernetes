# Terraform

Here is what [they](https://www.terraform.io/) say:

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services.

With respect to [helm](/helm.md):

The [Terraform Helm provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/helm/latest/docs) contains the helm_release resource that deploys a Helm chart to a Kubernetes cluster. The helm_release resource specifies the chart name and the configuration variables for your deployment.

`At this point, I do not feel that I have shared anything that really gives a feel for Terraform`
